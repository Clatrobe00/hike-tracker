## Description

A full-stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js) web application that allows the user to store hike names, dates, and distances in a MongoDB database and also keeps track of the user's total hike mileage.

This application is deployed at: https://hike-tracker-v2.herokuapp.com/

If you would like to make a contribution (or know of a good source of information for trails) simply make a pull request with a detailed description of your contribution, or feel free to contact me at my email: Charles.f.latrobe@gmail.com.
      
## Next
      
The most pressing feature I would like to add is a search feature that allows the user to locate a specific hiking area from a database- difficulties in finding an API that is supported and supplies trail information.
